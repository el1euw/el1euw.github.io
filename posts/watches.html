<h1>Watches</h1>
<p>The last decade or so, watches are becoming more smart with more and more accurate health features. Those things are bleeping and buzzing all day on your wrists telling you all sorts of things. Although fascinating tech and definitely has its use cases, I am not one of them.</p>

<p>I still have some in a drawer because fascinating tech and I also not immune to marketing. Yet, I always tend to grab one of my G-shocks. Yes, plural.</p>

<p>Automatic timesync, solar battery charging and no need to connect to a phone. Set and forget. More specifically, I like the traditional squares. Inconspicuous beater watches that last a lifetime. And will probably outlive me.</p>

<p>I’d suggest, if you’re not a sports person training for a specific goal or you don’t have any health issues a smart watch can help monitor, give away or sell your current smartwatch and get a disconnected set and forget watch. Or don’t get one and live watch-less. Live without a vibrating wrist is a more pleasant life.</p>
