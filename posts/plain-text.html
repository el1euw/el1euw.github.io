<h1>Plain Text</h1>
<p>If I don’t write it down, I will forget about it. So, I use a notebook for my to-do list.</p>

<p>Todos go on the right page, random notes go on the left. It’s loosly based on bulletjournal and todo.txt but reduced to it’s core without much of a rulebook. It must work for me instinctively with enough flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances otherwise I spend too much of time designing and tweaking and not using it.</p>

<p>The idea is that notes and todos are temporarily stuff that needs a short term action. It doesn’t do project management and it doesn’t function as a documentation system.</p>

<h2 id="todos">Todos</h2>
<p>The list is a weekly list. When something is done, it’s crossed off the list. Items that remains open at the end of a week will be transferred to the next week until it got done. There is no priority marking, it’s a First In - First Out list. Except when reality decides otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Notes are being processed as soon as possible, otherwise the specific context will fade from memory. And because my handwriting is unreadable without context, it’s a necessity to process those as soon as possible into more elaborate text, i.e. a wiki page or a project.</p>
